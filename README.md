A simple template for a [landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page).

This project was created as the [second practice project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) during my journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), the [first](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) being [_Recipes_](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/odin-recipes).

## Using the project

### Contributions


Anybody is more than welcome to contribute to this project.

Because this project is primarily for training purposes, I would appreciate it if commits included explanations of why changes to code have been made in the way they were made and how such changes improve the project.

**For novice learners of web development**, I would recommend that you refer to the design images (found under the directory `design-images` in this repo) and try to build the landing page from scratch yourself. Tips can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
